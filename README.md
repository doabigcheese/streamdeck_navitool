It will write the text to the buttons seen in the screenshot. \
The Satellite Button triggers for me the Autohotkey script for typing /showlocation \
The "Navitool" button starts the navitool from valalol

copy the files to your NaviTool installation from valalol's tool (https://github.com/Valalol/Star-Citizen-Navigation) 

pip install -r requirements.txt \
hideapi-win needs to get extracted and the dll copied to e.g. windows/system32
